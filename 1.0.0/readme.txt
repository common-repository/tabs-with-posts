== Screenshots ==

1. Very fast! This plugin will load in under 5 ms! How? This plugin includes a cache, which will create the widget in a background process, so no user will ever feel any lag. And also the plugin cache is fully compatible with all other WP plugins to cache pages, and able to evade them!

2. This plugin not only does provide an usually set of queries which will satisfy 90% of the users, but will also let users customize them how they want. Everything that a programmer can do to filter the posts, a user can do with a simple interface (filter by post statuses, post types, categories, posts, author, date, search, meta… etc) and order them by anything. Your imagination is the limit!

3. Displayed in a widget, either vertically or horizontally.

4. Put any meta where you want!

5. With 3 different styles to choose from, Simple style, YouTube style, and Modern style, but much more to come!

6. Just don’t overdo it!
