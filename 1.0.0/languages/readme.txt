If you want to translate these files, be careful because these will be deleted
if the plugin is updated. The name of the file should be tabs-with-posts-{locale}.mo
and tabs-with-posts-{locale}.po, for example tabs-with-posts-en_US.mo .

A better idea is to mail me a translation so I can update the plugin for
everyone, or use a plugin like Loco Translate, that will guarantee your
translation is not deleted in case of an update.
